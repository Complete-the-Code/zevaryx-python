# zevaryx-python

## What is this?

This is a toolkit for dbrand's CTC2 challenge (see [here](https://github.com/Complete-the-Code/symbol-status)). It includes tools for checking various strings for information.

A runnable version of this code exists on [Repl.it](https://replit.com/@zevaryx/fuckyoutom) (credit @tom c on Discord for the thought)

Requires an internet connection to run the first time, due to it automatically downloading a dictionary file
